This website is a showcase of everthing I did in MP151.

The site uses local storage to save any color scheme you choose, so go ahead and change it to your liking! (you can always change it back don't worry)

The colors you choose must be RGB with the format: "value1, value2, value3"
do not use parentheses or preface the color with 'rgb'.
